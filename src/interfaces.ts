// This works... but it actually compiles to a larger bundle size because when it is converted to regular JavaScript the Class has to be structured.
// We have another alternative in TypeScript (and in other Class based languages like C#, Java, etc.) and that is called Interfaces.
// Interfaces are essentially code contracts
// Interfaces allows us to enforce the shape of data expected (including optional properties).
